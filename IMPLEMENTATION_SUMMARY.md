## üîß Technical Notes

### Database Integration
The current implementation uses sample data for service packages. To fully integrate with a database:

1. Create a `ServicePackageRepository` interface
2. Create a `ServicePackageService` class
3. Update the controller to fetch packages from the database
4. Add database migration scripts for the `service_packages` table

### Booking Storage
The booking form submission currently shows a success message but doesn't persist data. To complete this:

1. Create a `Booking` entity
2. Create a `BookingRepository` and `BookingService`
3. Update the controller to save booking data
4. Add email notifications for booking confirmations

### Image Assets
The design references several images that should be added to `/images/`:
- `hero-laptop-repair.jpg` - Hero section background
- `hero-bg.jpg` - Hero overlay background
- Service package icons (if not using Font Awesome)

## üöÄ Ready for Production

- ‚úÖ Modern, professional design
- ‚úÖ Complete booking functionality
- ‚úÖ Responsive layout
- ‚úÖ Form validation
